# Investment Tracker

A **terminal-based investment tracking application** developed in **C++**.  
This project was created to practice core programming concepts such as data structures, file handling, and object-oriented design.

---

## 📌 Overview

Investment Tracker is a simple console application that allows users to store and manage basic investment information.  
The project focuses on clean C++ implementation rather than real-time financial data.

---

## ✨ Features

- Add new investment records
- Display stored investments
- Persist data using a text file
- Uses **Linked List** data structure
- Modular and readable C++ codebase
- Fully terminal-based interface

---

## 🧱 Technologies & Concepts Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Linked Lists
- File I/O
- Dynamic Memory Management
- Header / Source file separation

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was built to:

Strengthen understanding of C++ fundamentals

Practice implementing data structures from scratch

Gain experience with file-based data persistence

Build a simple but complete console application

## 🔮 Possible Improvements

Profit / loss calculation

Support for multiple asset types (stocks, crypto, etc.)

Input validation

Better menu navigation

Using a database (e.g., SQLite) instead of text files
